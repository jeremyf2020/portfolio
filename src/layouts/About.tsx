            I worked as a typesetter for years, and during this time, I found
            the work repetitive. I looked for ways to make my job more
            efficient. Finally, I self-taught Javascript to boost the
            efficiency. My department's working hours reduced from 12 hour to 9
            hours per day! This gave me more opportunities to collaborate with
            the IT team.

            The more I learn, the more I realized how much I don't know, and the
            more I desire.

            I decided to go back to school. However, after 1.5 year of studying,
            I had to pause my education due to family issue. Now, I'm keen to
            apply what I learnt and my passion for programming to Web
            development industry.
